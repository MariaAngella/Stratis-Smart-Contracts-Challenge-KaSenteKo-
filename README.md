# Stratis-Smart-Contracts-Challenge-KaSenteKo-
Ka-Sente-Ko is a credible system that VSLA's can use to calculate members' credibility scores.

Inspiration
The need to grow and evolve VSLA groups and their members

What it does
It takes in your savings,loans borrowed,amount shared out to calculate your credibility score and therefore estimate your ability to pay back a loan and the period of time within which you can pay back.

How we built it
Challenges we ran into
Transparency of these Saving Group Leaders. Narrowing down to solve just one problem and not the three major problems we initially had in mind.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Used the Human Centered Design technique to zero down the exact problem affecting these saving groups which was the need to grow and evolve their businesses and savings.

What we learned
These groups actually have solutions, all we did was listen to their stories and implement in the system.

What's next for Ka-Sente-Ko
We hope to generate enough funds to provide Credit to our credible members since most of the time the group account has little or no money saved especially during the beginning of the Saving cycle.
